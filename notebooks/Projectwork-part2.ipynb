    "## Brief Description of AI Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "I used AI tools to generate initial versions of the code, to refine and customize it, and to debug errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Coding, Improvement, and Tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "I described my requirements, and AI tools suggested initial drafts. While some of the generated code worked well, others required significant modification.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Debugging\n",
    "I used AI tools frequently for debugging, particularly for issues related to the Spark-Cassandra-MongoDB connector and writing data to Cassandra.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I noticed a key limitation: the error message and the code itself were often insufficient for the AI to solve the problem, leading to failed suggestions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, when I tried to write data to Cassandra, both ChatGPT and Gemini provided many suggestions based on the error code, but none of them fixed the issue. The actual problem was case sensitivity in Cassandra, a detail neither I nor the AI tools initially considered. The AI tools failed to suggest checking case sensitivity and continued offering irrelevant code changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Spark Connection:\n",
    "As mentioned, I had to take numerous steps to get the Spark-Cassandra-MongoDB connector functioning correctly. Both ChatGPT and Gemini provided theoretically correct setup methods for both connectors simultaneously, stating \"it should work.\" However, they failed to account for the specific execution context.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It took several days to begin checking where the .jar files were stored and how the choice of .jar files folder affected execution.   It took another two days to determine the correct location and, finally, one more day to discover how to properly utilize them (by creating a configuration file and referencing it in the Spark session builder). The error codes in VS Code did not provide possible causes for the underlying context issue.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, I realized that to use AI tools efficiently, I need to have a deeper, system-level understanding of how the entire code stack operates. It is difficult to know in advance what level of foundational knowledge I must possess and where the limitations of the AI tools lie.\n"
